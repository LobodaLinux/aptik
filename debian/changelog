  * Added option to filter list of packages by name, type and status
  
  * Removed the top toolbar.
  
  * Removed the installation summary prompt
  
  * Changed the code for getting list of installed PPAs. This should fix the issue where an empty list is returned on some systems.

  * Removed the infobar and messages at the top of each page
